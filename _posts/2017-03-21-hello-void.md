I would dive right into the first blog post in a series I actually have in
the works, but it's all very technical and there's no *context*. I'm just
shouting technical nonsense I worked really hard to understand into the void
and that might come off as rude. Wouldn't want to be rude to the void now, would
we?

Hello, void. Allow me to introduce myself for the googolianth time.

(I'm reading *Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close* by Jonathan Foer. It's largely
about a precocious nine-year-old who, at one point, touts his knowledge of the word
'googol' (a one with a hundred zeroes after it), so that's been rambling around in
my head. Besides, I like sounding like a precocious nine-year-old. They're slightly
more endearing than, well, most people. (Except when they're not, ugh.)

(I have a co-worker who thinks I am reading *Leviathan Wakes* and might would
hold me accountible for not returning his book if he found out I was claiming to
be reading other books behind *Leviathan Wakes*'s back, like a dirty cheater.
Allow me to indicate that I put the book down because my boyfriend took me to a
bookstore the other day, and I bought enough books to make my back hurt while I
carried them around the bookstore looking for *more books*, and it's not my
fault the shiny red hand on the cover of *Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close*
threatened to slap me if I didn't open it **right that second** and start
reading, and generally it is never the reader's fault if they cannot stop
reading a book, it is the author's.)

All of the white text on the black background may be frustrating. But I find
I like to read code on black backgrounds more than white, and if my code doesn't
look good on my blog *then how can I be expected to write about code*? When code
doesn't look pretty it flattens even the best of days.

That brings me back to introducing myself. I think it's good the void knows me -
it will, after all, claim me in the end anyway. I might as well stand up and
look it in the void... y... ness (...) before it gets the chance.

Hi. I'm Wendy. I'm a sopping romantic and a scatterbrained cynic and a
web developer. I like craft beer and watching your face when you talk about
that thing you care about - you know the one. You know more about it than is
strictly healthy. You may forget to eat sometimes because somebody said *the
thing about that thing* that is just so obviously wrong, for the love of God
why can't they see how wrong they are?! I love it when you talk about that
thing.

Unless it's sports ball.

Anyway. I read. I code. I ramble.

Here is a picture of my fur babies:
